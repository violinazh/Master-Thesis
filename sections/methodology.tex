Intuition: Ambiguous words generate less unique words in backtranslation than non-ambiguous words
Goal: detect ambiguous words in a sentence without context
	- Develop method(s) to differentiate from non-ambiguous words
	- Finetune parameters (e.g. how often ambiguous word reoccurs in backtranslation; how many unique words in translation vs. backtranslation)
	- Suggest alternative translations to ambiguous word
    - Differentiate ambiguous from biased words (cannot say if bias exists or not -> Quality Estimation)
