% TODO: MuST-SHE Unmasking with BERT 
% - Workflow 
% - Results 

This chapter describes an experiment in a real-world setting. The purpose of this experiment is to test the hypothesis in a natural setting. In the following, we outline the steps for executing the
experiment and the results of the evaluation.

\section{Data Preprocessing}
\label{sec:Real_Experiment:Preprocessing}


% First, we extract the sentences from the MuST-SHE datset, as presented in Subsection \ref{sec:Setup:Natural_Corpora}. 


% Extracted sentences from MuST-SHE exhibiting following gender phenomena: “No gender-disambiguating information can be retrieved.” (4th category)
%  - 34 sentences total (14F, 20M)
%  - Extracted 10 sample sentences for test (5M, 5F)
% 1) Unmask for each word in each sentence with BERT

\section{Translation}
\label{sec:Real_Experiment:Translation}

% same as base experiment

\section{Uniqueness Evaluation Results}
\label{sec:Real_Experiment:Results}

% refer to base experiment

% 2) Count unique backtranslations for each sentence and compare with the masked sentences for each word
