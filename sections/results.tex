% e.g. influence of language, context
% finding patterns in statistical results
% tables and graphical representations


% - Translation quality
% - Gender bias quality


% Compare original test set with disambiguated test set:
% - How different are translations in each nbest backtranslation list?
% - Are they more different for sentences with unresolved ambiguity?


% Expected results:
% - Original should have less unique sentences/words than disambiguated and non-ambiguous 
% - Original should have less unique words (aligned) in backtranslation than disambiguated and non-ambiguous
% - The rest of the sentence excluding the ambiguous word should have more unique words than the rest of the sentence excluding the disambigauted word
% ??? - The ambiguous word in a sentence generates more unique words in backtranslation than the rest of the sentence.
% Word occurrence: Check number of unique words for each word in sentence: non-ambiguous words such as stop words like “the” should have less unique translations 


% Variables to consider:
% - Word alignment method
% - Disambiguation method 
% - Search method
% - Nbest size
