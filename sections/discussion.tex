% Compare original test set with disambiguated test set:
% - How different are translations in each nbest backtranslation list?
% - Are they more different for sentences with unresolved ambiguity?

\label{sec:Discussion:Challenges}

% - Word alignment methods introduce errors, which influence the results
% - Not always having both genders present in the translation nbest list -> beam 100
% - Using “male” vs “female” for disambiguation yields different results
% -- NMT models bias leads to translation effects which in turn influence our method
