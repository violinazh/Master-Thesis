\label{ch:Conclusion}

% take ideas for Future work from literature reviews and thesis

% not only gender bias 

% The study could be extended to general ambiguity instead of only gender ambiguity.


% Future work:
% - Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) may help discover biased words
% WSD: technique in natural language processing (NLP), defined as the ability to determine which meaning of word is activated by the use of word in a particular context
% - Researching methods for Quality Estimation (QE) for detecting biases in translation
% QE: method for predicting the quality of a given translation rather than assessing how similar it is to a reference segment, E.g. multiple beams in Beam search: low confidence = high confidence for error in translation
